Our dataset consists of a significant volume of 33,634 songs, 2,662 artists and releases dating from 1963 to 2020. Employing big data techniques, we ensure efficient processing and detailed analysis of this extensive dataset.

Our dataset was constructed by concatenating the 'song_info' and 'artist_info' files using 'URL name' as the key. This merged file was then integrated with the 'song' column from the 'lyrics' file and organized into a dataframe for further analysis.
